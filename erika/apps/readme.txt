Those are some examples applications that were created during the development of this ErikaOS port.
They test the bare minimum of some of the features provided by the ErikaOS API.

Most applications can be run for both the QEMU verson as well as the real hardware.
An exception to this are the applications in the mindstorm folder.
Those are to showcase the combination of ErikaOS with Mindstorm Hardware!
